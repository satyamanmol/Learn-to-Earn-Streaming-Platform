# Learn-to-Earn Streaming Platform

## Project Description

The **Learn-to-Earn Streaming Platform** is a decentralized platform where users can earn cryptocurrency rewards by consuming educational content. The platform leverages blockchain technology to track user participation and reward them based on their activity. By watching educational videos or completing learning modules, users can accumulate tokens as incentives, which can then be claimed as rewards or used within the platform. The goal of the project is to encourage continuous learning by combining education with blockchain-based incentives.

## Contract Address

## Project Vision

The vision of the **Learn-to-Earn Streaming Platform** is to create an ecosystem that incentivizes learning through token-based rewards. The platform envisions:
- **Motivating Learners:** By rewarding learners for watching educational content, we hope to encourage more people to invest time in learning and personal growth.
- **Decentralized and Transparent:** Blockchain technology ensures that all user activities, rewards, and content interactions are transparent and verifiable.
- **Global Access:** The platform is designed to be globally accessible, allowing anyone with internet access to earn rewards by learning.
- **Seamless Integration:** Integration with existing streaming platforms or educational content providers can create a hybrid model of learning and earning.

## Key Features

1. **Watch-to-Earn Rewards:**
   - Users earn tokens by watching educational content. The more content they engage with, the more they learn and earn.

2. **Customizable Reward Rate:**
   - Platform administrators can set a reward rate (e.g., 1 token per 10 minutes of content viewed), which can be adjusted based on the type of content or user engagement.

3. **Tokenized Rewards:**
   - Users earn ERC20 tokens (or another token type) as rewards, which can be used for further learning, traded, or redeemed for other benefits within the platform.

4. **Blockchain-backed Certificates:**
   - Each completion or milestone reached can be recorded on the blockchain, giving users a verifiable record of their progress.

5. **Decentralized Access Control:**
   - Smart contracts control access to premium content, ensuring that users earn rewards for their engagement and that content is unlocked upon meeting specific criteria.

6. **Claim Rewards:**
   - Users can claim their accumulated reward points at any time. The rewards are distributed in a seamless, blockchain-secured manner.

7. **Secure, Transparent, and Immutable:**
   - All activities, user rewards, and content interactions are stored on the blockchain, ensuring that they are secure, transparent, and immutable.

## How to Deploy and Interact with the Contract

### 1. **Deploy the Contract:**
   - First, deploy the `LearnToEarn` contract on a blockchain like Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain.
   - Ensure that the contract address of the ERC20 token (reward token) is provided during deployment.

### 2. **Interacting with the Contract:**
   - **Log Watch Time:** Call the `logWatchTime(address user, uint256 watchTime)` function to track users' learning engagement.
   - **Claim Rewards:** Users can claim their earned rewards using the `claimRewards()` function.
   - **Check Balances:** Users can check their reward balances using `getRewardBalance(address user)`.
